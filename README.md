# OrientDB image

Base image that exposes an [`orientdb`][orientdb] instance, in ports `2424` and
`2480`, using the default root password _0r13ntDB_.

## Running

To execute the image:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb faroe228/docker-orientdb:latest
```

It's also possible to redirect `orientdb` ports:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 faroe228/docker-orientdb:latest
```

To use another root password, redefine the environment variable
`ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`:

```bash
docker run -d --name orientdb -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 -e ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin faroe228/docker-orientdb:latest
```
